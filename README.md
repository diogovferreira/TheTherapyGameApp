# TheTherapyGameApp
The therapy game app that supported the actual unity game

This mobile application was developed to embody the interface between the users and the game system.

In this mobile application, the therapists and patients, each one has different permissions. Upon Therapist Login, a list of associated patients is presented allowing him to take a set of actions towards each one. Some actions like create training plans for the patient where detailed information can be inserted regarding each game and its game play. Consult patients profile may contain helpful information for the rehabilitation process. Deleting patients from the database, erasing all their records within the database when therapists see their records are no longer needed. These are secondary tasks. The main task is actually the visualization of patient’s data sessions, where data will be presented in graphs. It is intended that with the sessions’ progression, physiotherapists can observe a clearer evolution on patient’s medical state.
